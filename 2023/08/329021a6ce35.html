<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>A common language (for the two ends to understand)</li>
<li>A way to address who you want to communicate with</li>
<li>A Connection (so the content of the communication can reach the recipients)</li>

What is Ethernet?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Ethernet simply refers to the most common type of Local Area Network (LAN) used today. A LAN—in contrast to a WAN (Wide Area Network), which spans a larger geographical area—is a connected network of computers in a small area, like your office, college campus, or even home.</p>
</b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is a MAC address? What is it used for?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>A MAC address is a unique identification number or code used to identify individual devices on the network.</p>
<p>Packets that are sent on the ethernet are always coming from a MAC address and sent to a MAC address. If a network adapter is receiving a packet, it is comparing the packet’s destination MAC address to the adapter’s own MAC address.</p>
</b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
When is this MAC address used?: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
When a device sends a packet to the broadcast MAC address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF​), it is delivered to all stations on the local network. Ethernet broadcasts are used to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses (by ARP) at the data link layer. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is an IP address?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Explain the subnet mask and give an example
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>A Subnet mask is a 32-bit number that masks an IP address and divides the IP addresses into network addresses and host addresses. Subnet Mask is made by setting network bits to all "1"s and setting host bits to all "0"s. Within a given network, out of the total usable host addresses, two are always reserved for specific purposes and cannot be allocated to any host. These are the first address, which is reserved as a network address (a.k.a network ID), and the last address used for network broadcast.</p>

<summary>
What is a private IP address? In which scenarios/system designs, one should use it?
</summary>
<br><b> Private IP addresses are assigned to the hosts in the same network to communicate with one another. As the name "private" suggests, the devices having the private IP addresses assigned can't be reached by the devices from any external network. For example, if I am living in a hostel and I want my hostel mates to join the game server I have hosted, I will ask them to join via my server's private IP address, since the network is local to the hostel. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is a public IP address? In which scenarios/system designs, one should use it?
</summary>
<br><b> A public IP address is a public-facing IP address. In the event that you were hosting a game server that you want your friends to join, you will give your friends your public IP address to allow their computers to identify and locate your network and server in order for the connection to take place. One time that you would not need to use a public-facing IP address is in the event that you were playing with friends who were connected to the same network as you, in that case, you would use a private IP address. In order for someone to be able to connect to your server that is located internally, you will have to set up a port forward to tell your router to allow traffic from the public domain into your network and vice versa. </b>

Explain the OSI model. What layers there are? What each layer is responsible for?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Application: user end (HTTP is here)</li>
<li>Presentation: establishes context between application-layer entities (Encryption is here)</li>
<li>Session: establishes, manages, and terminates the connections</li>
<li>Transport: transfers variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host (TCP &amp; UDP are here)</li>
<li>Network: transfers datagrams from one network to another (IP is here)</li>
<li>Data link: provides a link between two directly connected nodes (MAC is here)</li>

What is CSMA/CD? Is it used in modern ethernet networks?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection. Its primary focus is to manage access to a shared medium/bus where only one host can transmit at a given point in time.</p>
<p>CSMA/CD algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Before sending a frame, it checks whether another host is already transmitting a frame.</li>
<li>If no one is transmitting, it starts transmitting the frame.</li>
<li>If two hosts transmit at the same time, we have a collision.</li>
<li>Both hosts stop sending the frame and they send everyone a 'jam signal' notifying everyone that a collision occurred</li>
<li>They are waiting for a random time before sending it again</li>
<li>Once each host waited for a random time, they try to send the frame again and so the cycle starts again </b>

<p>Describe the following network devices and the difference between them:</p>
<ul>
<li>router</li>
<li>switch</li>
<li>hub
</summary>
<br><b></li>
</ul>
<p>A router, switch, and hub are all network devices used to connect devices in a local area network (LAN). However, each device operates differently and has its specific use cases. Here is a brief description of each device and the differences between them:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Router: a network device that connects multiple network segments together. It operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and uses routing protocols to direct data between networks. Routers use IP addresses to identify devices and route data packets to the correct destination.</li>
<li>Switch: a network device that connects multiple devices on a LAN. It operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and uses MAC addresses to identify devices and direct data packets to the correct destination. Switches allow devices on the same network to communicate with each other more efficiently and can prevent data collisions that can occur when multiple devices send data simultaneously.</li>
<li>Hub: a network device that connects multiple devices through a single cable and is used to connect multiple devices without segmenting a network. However, unlike a switch, it operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model and simply broadcasts data packets to all devices connected to it, regardless of whether the device is the intended recipient or not. This means that data collisions can occur, and the network's efficiency can suffer as a result. Hubs are generally not used in modern network setups, as switches are more efficient and provide better network performance. </b>
</details></li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>
What is a "Collision Domain"?
</summary>
<br><b> A collision domain is a network segment in which devices can potentially interfere with each other by attempting to transmit data at the same time. When two devices transmit data at the same time, it can cause a collision, resulting in lost or corrupted data. In a collision domain, all devices share the same bandwidth, and any device can potentially interfere with the transmission of data by other devices. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is a "Broadcast Domain"?
</summary>
<br><b> A broadcast domain is a network segment in which all devices can communicate with each other by sending broadcast messages. A broadcast message is a message that is sent to all devices in a network rather than a specific device. In a broadcast domain, all devices can receive and process broadcast messages, regardless of whether the message was intended for them or not. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
three computers connected to a switch. How many collision domains are there? How many broadcast domains?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Three collision domains and one broadcast domain </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
How does a router work?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>A router is a physical or virtual appliance that passes information between two or more packet-switched computer networks. A router inspects a given data packet's destination Internet Protocol address (IP address), calculates the best way for it to reach its destination, and then forwards it accordingly.</p>
</b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is NAT?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP addresses are translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to provide Internet access to the local hosts.</p>
</b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is a proxy? How does it work? What do we need it for?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>A proxy server acts as a gateway between you and the internet. It’s an intermediary server separating end users from the websites they browse.</p>
<p>If you’re using a proxy server, internet traffic flows through the proxy server on its way to the address you requested. The request then comes back through that same proxy server (there are exceptions to this rule), and then the proxy server forwards the data received from the website to you.</p>
Proxy servers provide varying levels of functionality, security, and privacy depending on your use case, needs, or company policy. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is TCP? How does it work? What is the 3-way handshake?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>TCP 3-way handshake or three-way handshake is a process that is used in a TCP/IP network to make a connection between server and client.</p>
<p>A three-way handshake is primarily used to create a TCP socket connection. It works when:</p>
<ul>
<li>A client node sends an SYN data packet over an IP network to a server on the same or an external network. The objective of this packet is to ask/infer if the server is open for new connections.</li>
<li>The target server must have open ports that can accept and initiate new connections. When the server receives the SYN packet from the client node, it responds and returns a confirmation receipt – the ACK packet or SYN/ACK packet.</li>

How does an SSL handshake work?
</summary>
<p><br><b> SSL handshake is a process that establishes a secure connection between a client and a server.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The client sends a Client Hello message to the server, which includes the client's version of the SSL/TLS protocol, a list of the cryptographic algorithms supported by the client, and a random value.</li>
<li>The server responds with a Server Hello message, which includes the server's version of the SSL/TLS protocol, a random value, and a session ID.</li>
<li>The server sends a Certificate message, which contains the server's certificate.</li>
<li>The server sends a Server Hello Done message, which indicates that the server is done sending messages for the Server Hello phase.</li>
<li>The client sends a Client Key Exchange message, which contains the client's public key.</li>
<li>The client sends a Change Cipher Spec message, which notifies the server that the client is about to send a message encrypted with the new cipher spec.</li>
<li>The client sends an Encrypted Handshake Message, which contains the pre-master secret encrypted with the server's public key.</li>
<li>The server sends a Change Cipher Spec message, which notifies the client that the server is about to send a message encrypted with the new cipher spec.</li>

What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>TCP establishes a connection between the client and the server to guarantee the order of the packages, on the other hand, UDP does not establish a connection between the client and server and doesn't handle package orders. This makes UDP more lightweight than TCP and a perfect candidate for services like streaming.</p>

What is ARP? How does it work?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. When you try to ping an IP address on your local network, say 192.168.1.1, your system has to turn the IP address 192.168.1.1 into a MAC address. This involves using ARP to resolve the address, hence its name.</p>
Systems keep an ARP look-up table where they store information about what IP addresses are associated with what MAC addresses. When trying to send a packet to an IP address, the system will first consult this table to see if it already knows the MAC address. If there is a value cached, ARP is not used. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is TTL? What does it help to prevent?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>TTL (Time to Live) is a value in an IP (Internet Protocol) packet that determines how many hops or routers a packet can travel before it is discarded. Each time a packet is forwarded by a router, the TTL value is decreased by one. When the TTL value reaches zero, the packet is dropped, and an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) message is sent back to the sender indicating that the packet has expired.</li>
<li>TTL is used to prevent packets from circulating indefinitely in the network, which can cause congestion and degrade network performance.</li>
<li>It also helps to prevent packets from being trapped in routing loops, where packets continuously travel between the same set of routers without ever reaching their destination.</li>
<li>In addition, TTL can be used to help detect and prevent IP spoofing attacks, where an attacker attempts to impersonate another device on the network by using a false or fake IP address. By limiting the number of hops that a packet can travel, TTL can help prevent packets from being routed to destinations that are not legitimate. </b>

What is DHCP? How does it work?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>It stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and allocates IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to hosts. This is how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>A host upon entering a network broadcasts a message in search of a DHCP server (DHCP DISCOVER)</li>
<li>An offer message is sent back by the DHCP server as a packet containing lease time, subnet mask, IP addresses, etc (DHCP OFFER)</li>
<li>Depending on which offer is accepted, the client sends back a reply broadcast letting all DHCP servers know (DHCP REQUEST)</li>
<li>The server sends an acknowledgment (DHCP ACK)</li>

Can you have two DHCP servers on the same network? How does it work?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>It is possible to have two DHCP servers on the same network, however, it is not recommended, and it is important to configure them carefully to prevent conflicts and configuration problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>When two DHCP servers are configured on the same network, there is a risk that both servers will assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings to the same device, which can cause conflicts and connectivity issues. Additionally, if the DHCP servers are configured with different network settings or options, devices on the network may receive conflicting or inconsistent configuration settings.</li>
<li>However, in some cases, it may be necessary to have two DHCP servers on the same network, such as in large networks where one DHCP server may not be able to handle all the requests. In such cases, DHCP servers can be configured to serve different IP address ranges or different subnets, so they do not interfere with each other. </b>

What is SSL tunneling? How does it work?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) tunneling is a technique used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between two endpoints over an insecure network, such as the Internet. The SSL tunnel is created by encapsulating the traffic within an SSL connection, which provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how SSL tunneling works:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A client initiates an SSL connection to a server, which involves a handshake process to establish the SSL session.</li>
<li>Once the SSL session is established, the client and server negotiate encryption parameters, such as the encryption algorithm and key length, then exchange digital certificates to authenticate each other.</li>
<li>The client then sends traffic through the SSL tunnel to the server, which decrypts the traffic and forwards it to its destination.</li>
<li>The server sends traffic back through the SSL tunnel to the client, which decrypts the traffic and forwards it to the application. </b>

What is IPv6? Why should we consider using it if we have IPv4?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP), which is used to identify and communicate with devices on a network. IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses and are expressed in hexadecimal notation, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several reasons why we should consider using IPv6 over IPv4:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Address space: IPv4 has a limited address space, which has been exhausted in many parts of the world. IPv6 provides a much larger address space, allowing for trillions of unique IP addresses.</li>
<li>Security: IPv6 includes built-in support for IPsec, which provides end-to-end encryption and authentication for network traffic.</li>
<li>Performance: IPv6 includes features that can help to improve network performance, such as multicast routing, which allows a single packet to be sent to multiple destinations simultaneously.</li>
<li>Simplified network configuration: IPv6 includes features that can simplify network configuration, such as stateless autoconfiguration, which allows devices to automatically configure their own IPv6 addresses without the need for a DHCP server.</li>
<li>Better mobility support: IPv6 includes features that can improve mobility support, such as Mobile IPv6, which allows devices to maintain their IPv6 addresses as they move between different networks. </b>

</details>
<details>
<summary>
What happens if you send a packet that is bigger than the MTU?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>With the IPv4 protocol, the router can fragment the PDU and then send all the fragmented PDU through the transaction.</p>
With IPv6 protocol, it issues an error to the user's computer. </b>

</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>SDN stands for Software-Defined Networking. It is an approach to network management that emphasizes the centralization of network control, enabling administrators to manage network behavior through a software abstraction.</li>
<li>In a traditional network, network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls are configured and managed individually, using specialized software or command-line interfaces. In contrast, SDN separates the network control plane from the data plane, allowing administrators to manage network behavior through a centralized software controller. </b>

<li>ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. It is a protocol used for diagnostic and control purposes in IP networks. It is a part of the Internet Protocol suite, operating at the network layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>ICMP messages are used for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Error reporting: ICMP messages are used to report errors that occur in the network, such as a packet that could not be delivered to its destination.</li>
<li>Ping: ICMP is used to send ping messages, which are used to test whether a host or network is reachable and to measure the round-trip time for packets.</li>
<li>Path MTU discovery: ICMP is used to discover the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of a path, which is the largest packet size that can be transmitted without fragmentation.</li>
<li>Traceroute: ICMP is used by the traceroute utility to trace the path that packets take through the network.</li>
<li>Router discovery: ICMP is used to discover the routers in a network. </b>

What is NAT? How does it work?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
NAT stands for Network Address Translation. It’s a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring the information. Organizations that want multiple devices to employ a single IP address use NAT, as do most home routers. For example, your computer's private IP could be 192.168.1.100, but your router maps the traffic to its public IP (e.g. 1.1.1.1). Any device on the internet would see the traffic coming from your public IP (1.1.1.1) instead of your private IP (192.168.1.100). </b>

<li>Latency: Latency refers to the delay that occurs when data is transmitted from one point in a network to another. High latency can result in slow network performance, especially for real-time applications like video conferencing and online gaming.</li>
<li>Network congestion: When too many devices are using a network at the same time, network congestion can occur, leading to slow data transfer rates and poor network performance.</li>
<li>Packet loss: Packet loss occurs when packets of data are dropped during transmission. This can result in slower network speeds and lower overall network performance.</li>
<li>Network topology: The physical layout of a network, including the placement of switches, routers, and other network devices, can impact network performance.</li>
<li>Network protocol: Different network protocols have different performance characteristics, which can impact network performance. For example, TCP is a reliable protocol that can guarantee the delivery of data, but it can also result in slower performance due to the overhead required for error checking and retransmission.</li>
<li>Network security: Security measures such as firewalls and encryption can impact network performance, especially if they require significant processing power or introduce additional latency.</li>
<li>Distance: The physical distance between devices on a network can impact network performance, especially for wireless networks where signal strength and interference can affect connectivity and data transfer rates. </b>

</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a routing protocol that can be implemented on various types of routers. In general, OSPF is supported on most modern routers, including those from vendors such as Cisco, Juniper, and Huawei. The protocol is designed to work with IP-based networks, including both IPv4 and IPv6. Also, it uses a hierarchical network design, where routers are grouped into areas, with each area having its own topology map and routing table. This design helps to reduce the amount of routing information that needs to be exchanged between routers and improve network scalability.</p>
<p>The OSPF 4 Types of routers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal Router</li>
<li>Area Border Routers</li>
<li>Autonomous Systems Boundary Routers</li>

This is possible with time sharing where computing resources are shared in a way it seems to the user the system has multiple CPUs but in fact it's simply one CPU shared by applying multiprogramming and multi-tasking. </b>

What is "space sharing"?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Somewhat the opposite of time sharing. While in time sharing a resource is used for a while by one entity and then the same resource can be used by another resource, in space sharing the space is shared by multiple entities but in a way where it's not being transferred between them.<br> It's used by one entity until this entity decides to get rid of it. Take for example storage. In storage, a file is yours until you decide to delete it. </b>

What is "virtual memory" and what purpose it serves?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Virtual memory combines your computer's RAM with temporary space on your hard disk. When RAM runs low, virtual memory helps to move data from RAM to a space called a paging file. Moving data to paging file can free up the RAM so your computer can complete its work. In general, the more RAM your computer has, the faster the programs run. https://www.minitool.com/lib/virtual-memory.html </b>

What is copy-on-write?
</summary>
<p><br><b> Copy-on-write (COW) is a resource management concept, with the goal to reduce unnecessary copying of information. It is a concept which is implemented for instance within the POSIX fork syscall, which creates a duplicate process of the calling process.</p>
<p>The idea:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If resources are shared between 2 or more entities (for example shared memory segments between 2 processes) the resources don't need to be copied for every entity, but rather every entity has a READ operation access permission on the shared resource. (the shared segements are marked as read-only) (Think of every entity having a pointer to the location of the shared resource which can be dereferenced to read its value)</li>
<li>If one entity would perform a WRITE operation on a shared resource a problem would arise since the resource also would be permanently changed for ALL other entities sharing it. (Think of a process modifying some variables on the stack, or allocatingy some data dynamically on the heap, these changes to the shared resource would also apply for ALL other processes, this is definetly an undesirable behaviour)</li>
<li>As a solution only if a WRITE operation is about to be performed on a shared resource, this resource gets COPIED first and then the changes are applied. </b>

What is Prometheus? What are some of Prometheus's main features?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Prometheus is a popular open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, originally developed at SoundCloud. It is designed to collect and store time-series data, and to allow for querying and analysis of that data using a powerful query language called PromQL. Prometheus is frequently used to monitor cloud-native applications, microservices, and other modern infrastructure.</p>
<p>Some of the main features of Prometheus include:</p>
<pre><code>1. Data model: Prometheus uses a flexible data model that allows users to organize and label their time-series data in a way that makes sense for their particular use case. Labels are used to identify different dimensions of the data, such as the source of the data or the environment in which it was collected.

2. Pull-based architecture: Prometheus uses a pull-based model to collect data from targets, meaning that the Prometheus server actively queries its targets for metrics data at regular intervals. This architecture is more scalable and reliable than a push-based model, which would require every target to push data to the server.

3. Time-series database: Prometheus stores all of its data in a time-series database, which allows users to perform queries over time ranges and to aggregate and analyze their data in various ways. The database is optimized for write-heavy workloads, and can handle a high volume of data with low latency.

4. Alerting: Prometheus includes a powerful alerting system that allows users to define rules based on their metrics data and to send alerts when certain conditions are met. Alerts can be sent via email, chat, or other channels, and can be customized to include specific details about the problem.

5. Visualization: Prometheus has a built-in graphing and visualization tool, called PromDash, which allows users to create custom dashboards to monitor their systems and applications. PromDash supports a variety of graph types and visualization options, and can be customized using CSS and JavaScript.</code></pre>
<p>Overall, Prometheus is a powerful and flexible tool for monitoring and analyzing systems and applications, and is widely used in the industry for cloud-native monitoring and observability.</p>

<summary>
Describe Prometheus architecture and components
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>The Prometheus architecture consists of four major components:</p>
<pre><code>1. Prometheus Server: The Prometheus server is responsible for collecting and storing metrics data. It has a simple built-in storage layer that allows it to store time-series data in a time-ordered database.

2. Client Libraries: Prometheus provides a range of client libraries that enable applications to expose their metrics data in a format that can be ingested by the Prometheus server. These libraries are available for a range of programming languages, including Java, Python, and Go.

3. Exporters: Exporters are software components that expose existing metrics from third-party systems and make them available for ingestion by the Prometheus server. Prometheus provides exporters for a range of popular technologies, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Apache.

4. Alertmanager: The Alertmanager component is responsible for processing alerts generated by the Prometheus server. It can handle alerts from multiple sources and provides a range of features for deduplicating, grouping, and routing alerts to appropriate channels.</code></pre>
Overall, the Prometheus architecture is designed to be highly scalable and resilient. The server and client libraries can be deployed in a distributed fashion to support monitoring across large-scale, highly dynamic environments </b>
</details>

<summary>
Can you compare Prometheus to other solutions like InfluxDB for example?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Compared to other monitoring solutions, such as InfluxDB, Prometheus is known for its high performance and scalability. It can handle large volumes of data and can easily be integrated with other tools in the monitoring ecosystem. InfluxDB, on the other hand, is known for its ease of use and simplicity. It has a user-friendly interface and provides easy-to-use APIs for collecting and querying data.</p>
<p>Another popular solution, Nagios, is a more traditional monitoring system that relies on a push-based model for collecting data. Nagios has been around for a long time and is known for its stability and reliability. However, compared to Prometheus, Nagios lacks some of the more advanced features, such as multi-dimensional data model and powerful query language.</p>
Overall, the choice of a monitoring solution depends on the specific needs and requirements of the organization. While Prometheus is a great choice for large-scale monitoring and alerting, InfluxDB may be a better fit for smaller environments that require ease of use and simplicity. Nagios remains a solid choice for organizations that prioritize stability and reliability over advanced features. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is an Alert?
</summary>
<br><b> In Prometheus, an alert is a notification triggered when a specific condition or threshold is met. Alerts can be configured to trigger when certain metrics cross a certain threshold or when specific events occur. Once an alert is triggered, it can be routed to various channels, such as email, pager, or chat, to notify relevant teams or individuals to take appropriate action. Alerts are a critical component of any monitoring system, as they allow teams to proactively detect and respond to issues before they impact users or cause system downtime. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is an Instance? What is a Job?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>In Prometheus, an instance refers to a single target that is being monitored. For example, a single server or service. A job is a set of instances that perform the same function, such as a set of web servers serving the same application. Jobs allow you to define and manage a group of targets together.</p>
In essence, an instance is an individual target that Prometheus collects metrics from, while a job is a collection of similar instances that can be managed as a group. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What core metrics types Prometheus supports?
</summary>
<p><br><b> Prometheus supports several types of metrics, including:</p>
<pre><code>1. Counter: A monotonically increasing value used for tracking counts of events or samples. Examples include the number of requests processed or the total number of errors encountered.

2. Gauge: A value that can go up or down, such as CPU usage or memory usage. Unlike counters, gauge values can be arbitrary, meaning they can go up and down based on changes in the system being monitored.

3. Histogram: A set of observations or events that are divided into buckets based on their value. Histograms help in analyzing the distribution of a metric, such as request latencies or response sizes.

4. Summary: A summary is similar to a histogram, but instead of buckets, it provides a set of quantiles for the observed values. Summaries are useful for monitoring the distribution of request latencies or response sizes over time.</code></pre>
Prometheus also supports various functions and operators for aggregating and manipulating metrics, such as sum, max, min, and rate. These features make it a powerful tool for monitoring and alerting on system metrics. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is an exporter? What is it used for?
</summary>
<p><br><b> The exporter serves as a bridge between the third-party system or application and Prometheus, making it possible for Prometheus to monitor and collect data from that system or application.</p>
<p>The exporter acts as a server, listening on a specific network port for requests from Prometheus to scrape metrics. It collects metrics from the third-party system or application and transforms them into a format that can be understood by Prometheus. The exporter then exposes these metrics to Prometheus via an HTTP endpoint, making them available for collection and analysis.</p>
<p>Exporters are commonly used to monitor various types of infrastructure components such as databases, web servers, and storage systems. For example, there are exporters available for monitoring popular databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as web servers like Apache and Nginx.</p>
Overall, exporters are a critical component of the Prometheus ecosystem, allowing for the monitoring of a wide range of systems and applications, and providing a high degree of flexibility and extensibility to the platform. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Which Prometheus best practices?
</summary>
<p><br><b> Here are three of them:</p>
<pre><code>1. Label carefully: Careful and consistent labeling of metrics is crucial for effective querying and alerting. Labels should be clear, concise, and include all relevant information about the metric.

2. Keep metrics simple: The metrics exposed by exporters should be simple and focus on a single aspect of the system being monitored. This helps avoid confusion and ensures that the metrics are easily understandable by all members of the team.

3. Use alerting sparingly: While alerting is a powerful feature of Prometheus, it should be used sparingly and only for the most critical issues. Setting up too many alerts can lead to alert fatigue and result in important alerts being ignored. It is recommended to set up only the most important alerts and adjust the thresholds over time based on the actual frequency of alerts.</code></pre>

How to get total requests in a given period of time?
</summary>
<p><br><b> To get the total requests in a given period of time using Prometheus, you can use the <em>sum</em> function along with the <em>rate</em> function. Here is an example query that will give you the total number of requests in the last hour:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sum(rate(http_requests_total[1h]))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>In this query, <em>http_requests_total</em> is the name of the metric that tracks the total number of HTTP requests, and the <em>rate</em> function calculates the per-second rate of requests over the last hour. The <em>sum</em> function then adds up all of the requests to give you the total number of requests in the last hour.</p>
You can adjust the time range by changing the duration in the <em>rate</em> function. For example, if you wanted to get the total number of requests in the last day, you could change the function to <em>rate(http_requests_total[1d])</em>. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What HA in Prometheus means?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
HA stands for High Availability. This means that the system is designed to be highly reliable and always available, even in the face of failures or other issues. In practice, this typically involves setting up multiple instances of Prometheus and ensuring that they are all synchronized and able to work together seamlessly. This can be achieved through a variety of techniques, such as load balancing, replication, and failover mechanisms. By implementing HA in Prometheus, users can ensure that their monitoring data is always available and up-to-date, even in the face of hardware or software failures, network issues, or other problems that might otherwise cause downtime or data loss. </b>

<summary>
How do you join two metrics?
</summary>
<p><br><b> In Prometheus, joining two metrics can be achieved using the <em>join()</em> function. The <em>join()</em> function combines two or more time series based on their label values. It takes two mandatory arguments: <em>on</em> and <em>table</em>. The on argument specifies the labels to join <em>on</em> and the <em>table</em> argument specifies the time series to join.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how to join two metrics using the <em>join()</em> function:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">sum_series(</span><br><span class="line">  join(</span><br><span class="line">    on(service, instance) request_count_total,</span><br><span class="line">    on(service, instance) error_count_total,</span><br><span class="line">  )</span><br><span class="line">)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
In this example, the <em>join()</em> function combines the <em>request_count_total</em> and <em>error_count_total</em> time series based on their <em>service</em> and <em>instance</em> label values. The <em>sum_series()</em> function then calculates the sum of the resulting time series </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
How to write a query that returns the value of a label?
</summary>
<p><br><b> To write a query that returns the value of a label in Prometheus, you can use the <em>label_values</em> function. The <em>label_values</em> function takes two arguments: the name of the label and the name of the metric.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a metric called <em>http_requests_total</em> with a label called <em>method</em>, and you want to return all the values of the <em>method</em> label, you can use the following query:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">label_values(http_requests_total, method)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
This will return a list of all the values for the <em>method</em> label in the <em>http_requests_total</em> metric. You can then use this list in further queries or to filter your data. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
How do you convert cpu_user_seconds to cpu usage in percentage?
</summary>
<p><br><b> To convert <em>cpu_user_seconds</em> to CPU usage in percentage, you need to divide it by the total elapsed time and the number of CPU cores, and then multiply by 100. The formula is as follows:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">100 * sum(rate(process_cpu_user_seconds_total&#123;job=&quot;&lt;job-name&gt;&quot;&#125;[&lt;time-period&gt;])) by (instance) / (&lt;time-period&gt; * &lt;num-cpu-cores&gt;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Here, <em><job-name></em> is the name of the job you want to query, <em><time-period></em> is the time range you want to query (e.g. <em>5m</em>, <em>1h</em>), and <em><num-cpu-cores></em> is the number of CPU cores on the machine you are querying.</p>
<p>For example, to get the CPU usage in percentage for the last 5 minutes for a job named <em>my-job</em> running on a machine with 4 CPU cores, you can use the following query:</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">100 * sum(rate(process_cpu_user_seconds_total&#123;job=&quot;my-job&quot;&#125;[5m])) by (instance) / (5m * 4)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<summary>
What are the advantages of MongoDB? Or in other words, why choosing MongoDB and not other implementation of NoSQL?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>MongoDB advantages are as followings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schemaless</li>
<li>Easy to scale-out</li>
<li>No complex joins</li>
<li>Structure of a single object is clear</li>
</ul>
</b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
In what scenarios would you prefer to use NoSQL/Mongo over SQL?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Heterogeneous data which changes often</li>
<li>Data consistency and integrity is not top priority</li>
<li>Best if the database needs to scale rapidly </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What is a document? What is a collection?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>A document is a record in MongoDB, which is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format and is the basic unit of data in MongoDB.</li>
<li>A collection is a group of related documents stored in a single database in MongoDB. </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What is an aggregator?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>An aggregator is a framework in MongoDB that performs operations on a set of data to return a single computed result. </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What is better? Embedded documents or referenced?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>There is no definitive answer to which is better, it depends on the specific use case and requirements. Some explainations : Embedded documents provide atomic updates, while referenced documents allow for better normalization. </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
Have you performed data retrieval optimizations in Mongo? If not, can you think about ways to optimize a slow data retrieval?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Some ways to optimize data retrieval in MongoDB are: indexing, proper schema design, query optimization and database load balancing. </b>

What is SQL?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for relational databases (like MySQL, MariaDB, ...).<br> It's used for reading, updating, removing and creating data in a relational database. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
How is SQL Different from NoSQL
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
The main difference is that SQL databases are structured (data is stored in the form of tables with rows and columns - like an excel spreadsheet table) while NoSQL is unstructured, and the data storage can vary depending on how the NoSQL DB is set up, such as key-value pair, document-oriented, etc. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
When is it best to use SQL? NoSQL?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>SQL - Best used when data integrity is crucial. SQL is typically implemented with many businesses and areas within the finance field due to it's ACID compliance.</p>
<p>NoSQL - Great if you need to scale things quickly. NoSQL was designed with web applications in mind, so it works great if you need to quickly spread the same information around to multiple servers</p>
Additionally, since NoSQL does not adhere to the strict table with columns and rows structure that Relational Databases require, you can store different data types together. </b>

</details>
<details>
<summary>
How would you join the customer table to the order table?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
You would join them on the unique key. In this case, the unique key is Customer_ID in both the Customers table and Orders table </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
How would you show which customer ordered which items?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Select c.Customer_Name, o.Item <br> From Customers c <br> Left Join Orders o <br> On c.Customer_ID = o.Customer_ID;</p>
</b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Using a with statement, how would you show who ordered cat food, and the total amount of money spent?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>with cat_food as ( <br> Select Customer_ID, SUM(Price) as TOTAL_PRICE <br> From Orders <br> Where Item like "%Cat Food%" <br> Group by Customer_ID <br> ) <br> Select Customer_name, TOTAL_PRICE <br> From Customers c <br> Inner JOIN cat_food f <br> ON c.Customer_ID = f.Customer_ID <br> where c.Customer_ID in (Select Customer_ID from cat_food);</p>
<p>Although this was a simple statement, the "with" clause really shines when a complex query needs to be run on a table before joining to another. With statements are nice, because you create a pseudo temp when running your query, instead of creating a whole new table.</p>
The Sum of all the purchases of cat food weren't readily available, so we used a with statement to create the pseudo table to retrieve the sum of the prices spent by each customer, then join the table normally. </b>

<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Puppet has a primary-secondary node architecture. The clients are distributed across the network and communicate with the primary-secondary environment where Puppet modules are present. The client agent sends a certificate with its ID to the server; the server then signs that certificate and sends it back to the client. This authentication allows for secure and verifiable communication between the client and the master. </b>

<summary>
What is Kibana?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>From the official docs:</p>
"Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps." </b>

Describe what happens from the moment an app logged some information until it's displayed to the user in a dashboard when the Elastic stack is used
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>The process may vary based on the chosen architecture and the processing you may want to apply to the logs. One possible workflow is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The data logged by the application is picked by filebeat and sent to logstash</li>
<li>Logstash process the log based on the defined filters. Once done, the output is sent to Elasticsearch</li>
<li>Elasticsearch stores the document it got and the document is indexed for quick future access</li>
<li>The user creates visualizations in Kibana which based on the indexed data</li>
<li>The user creates a dashboard which composed out of the visualization created in the previous step </b>

</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is a master node?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Part of a master node responsibilites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track the status of all the nodes in the cluster</li>
<li>Verify replicas are working and the data is available from every data node.</li>
<li>No hot nodes (no data node that works much harder than other nodes)</li>
</ul>
While there can be multiple master nodes in reality only of them is the elected master node. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is an ingest node?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
A node which responsible for processing the data according to ingest pipeline. In case you don't need to use logstash then this node can recieve data from beats and process it, similarly to how it can be processed in Logstash. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is Coordinating only node?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>From the official docs:</p>
<p>Coordinating only nodes can benefit large clusters by offloading the coordinating node role from data and master-eligible nodes. They join the cluster and receive the full cluster state, like every other node, and they use the cluster state to route requests directly to the appropriate place(s).</p>

<details>
<summary>
How data is stored in Elasticsearch?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>Data is stored in an index</li>
<li>The index is spread across the cluster using shards </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
What is an Index?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>Index in Elasticsearch is in most cases compared to a whole database from the SQL/NoSQL world.<br> You can choose to have one index to hold all the data of your app or have multiple indices where each index holds different type of your app (e.g. index for each service your app is running).</p>
<p>The official docs also offer a great explanation (in general, it's really good documentation, as every project should have):</p>
"An index can be thought of as an optimized collection of documents and each document is a collection of fields, which are the key-value pairs that contain your data" </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Explain Shards
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
An index is split into shards and documents are hashed to a particular shard. Each shard may be on a different node in a cluster and each one of the shards is a self contained index.<br> This allows Elasticsearch to scale to an entire cluster of servers. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is an Inverted Index?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>From the official docs:</p>
"An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in." </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What is a Document?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Continuing with the comparison to SQL/NoSQL a Document in Elasticsearch is a row in table in the case of SQL or a document in a collection in the case of NoSQL. As in NoSQL a document is a JSON object which holds data on a unit in your app. What is this unit depends on the your app. If your app related to book then each document describes a book. If you are app is about shirts then each document is a shirt. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
You check the health of your elasticsearch cluster and it's red. What does it mean? What can cause the status to be yellow instead of green?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
Red means some data is unavailable in your cluster. Some shards of your indices are unassinged. There are some other states for the cluster. Yellow means that you have unassigned shards in the cluster. You can be in this state if you have single node and your indices have replicas. Green means that all shards in the cluster are assigned to nodes and your cluster is healthy. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
True or False? Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed field has the same data structure for unified and quick query ability
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>False. From the official docs:</p>
"Each indexed field has a dedicated, optimized data structure. For example, text fields are stored in inverted indices, and numeric and geo fields are stored in BKD trees." </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What reserved fields a document has?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>_index</li>
<li>_id</li>
<li>_type </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
Explain Mapping
</summary>
<br><b> </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
What are the advantages of defining your own mapping? (or: when would you use your own mapping?)
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>You can optimize fields for partial matching</li>
<li>You can define custom formats of known fields (e.g. date)</li>
<li>You can perform language-specific analysis </b>
</details></li>
</ul>
<details>
<summary>
Explain Replicas
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
In a network/cloud environment where failures can be expected any time, it is very useful and highly recommended to have a failover mechanism in case a shard/node somehow goes offline or disappears for whatever reason. To this end, Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards into what are called replica shards, or replicas for short. </b>

By using an API gateway, organizations can simplify the management of their APIs, ensure consistent security and governance, and improve the performance and scalability of their backend services. They are also commonly used in microservices architectures, where there are many small, independent services that need to be accessed by different clients. </b>

<li>Enhances scalability: Can handle traffic spikes and distribute requests to backend services in a way that maximizes resource utilization and improves overall system performance.</li>
<li>Enables service composition: Can combine different backend services into a single API, providing more granular control over the services that clients can access.</li>
<li>Facilitates integration with external systems: Can be used to expose internal services to external partners or customers, making it easier to integrate with external systems and enabling new business models.</li>

<ul>
<li>Proxies can be used for load balancing, distributing traffic across multiple servers to help prevent server overload and improve website or application performance.

<p>A reverse proxy is a type of proxy server that sits between a client and a server, but it is used to manage traffic going in the opposite direction of a traditional forward proxy. In a forward proxy, the client sends requests to the proxy server, which then forwards them to the destination server. However, in a reverse proxy, the client sends requests to the destination server, but the requests are intercepted by the reverse proxy before they reach the server.</p>
<ul>
<li>They're commonly used to improve web server performance, provide high availability and fault tolerance, and enhance security by preventing direct access to the back-end server.

<p><br><b></p>
<ul>
<li>A simple round robin algorithm knows nothing about the load and the spec of each server it forwards the requests to. It is possible, that multiple heavy workloads requests will get to the same server while other servers will got only lightweight requests which will result in one server doing most of the work, maybe even crashing at some point because it unable to handle all the heavy workloads requests by its own.</li>
<li>Each request from the client creates a whole new session. This might be a problem for certain scenarios where you would like to perform multiple operations where the server has to know about the result of operation so basically, being sort of aware of the history it has with the client. In round robin, first request might hit server X, while second request might hit server Y and ask to continue processing the data that was processed on server X already. </b>

</summary>
<p><br><b> Caching and databases serve different purposes and are optimized for different use cases.</p>
<p>Caching is used to speed up read operations by storing frequently accessed data in memory or on a fast storage medium. By keeping data close to the application, caching reduces the latency and overhead of accessing data from a slower, more distant storage system such as a database or disk.</p>
On the other hand, databases are optimized for storing and managing persistent data. Databases are designed to handle concurrent read and write operations, enforce consistency and integrity constraints, and provide features such as indexing and querying. </b>

What is a CPU?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
A central processing unit (CPU) performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs). </b>

<details>
<summary>
What is RAM?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
RAM (Random Access Memory) is the hardware in a computing device where the operating system (OS), application programs and data in current use are kept so they can be quickly reached by the device's processor. RAM is the main memory in a computer. It is much faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage, such as a hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD) or optical drive. </b>

</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>An answer from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-architecture">talend.com</a>:</p>
"Data architecture is the process of standardizing how organizations collect, store, transform, distribute, and use data. The goal is to deliver relevant data to people who need it, when they need it, and help them make sense of it." </b>

<details>
<summary>
What is Packer? What is it used for?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
In general, Packer automates machine images creation. It allows you to focus on configuration prior to deployment while making the images. This allows you start the instances much faster in most cases. </b>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Packer follows a "configuration-&gt;deployment" model or "deployment-&gt;configuration"?
</summary>
<p><br><b></p>
<p>A configuration-&gt;deployment which has some advantages like:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Deployment Speed - you configure once prior to deployment instead of configuring every time you deploy. This allows you to start instances/services much quicker.</li>
<li>More immutable infrastructure - with configuration-&gt;deployment it's not likely to have very different deployments since most of the configuration is done prior to the deployment. Issues like dependencies errors are handled/discovered prior to deployment in this model. </b>
